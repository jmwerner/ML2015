LDA Readme
=====

This script will run a LDA classification algorithm on an example that uses Fisher's iris data. The script was coded as an illustration, using formulas provided in the Elements of Statistical Learning textbook. Currently it is not coded to be used for other data sets or with more than 2 classes, it simply illustrates this 2 dimensional example.
