kNN Readme
=====

This script will run a kNN classification and predict classification outputs for a 2-dimensional data set in its current state.  

To Do
-----
1. Adapt for higher than 2-dimensional data sets
2. Fix ties in both the voting function and distance function (add warning messages as well)
3. Clean up specific data types for inputs/outputs of functions
4. Add execution examples (example is currently embeded in the script itself)
