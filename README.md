ML2015
======

Machine Learning code snippets from a winter quarter 2015 independent study run in parallel with [this](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about) Stanford online course. Selected algorithms will be coded by hand and understood in depth to supplement and enhance the online course. Code will be written primarily in `Julia` and `R` because those are Jeremy's strongest languages. Although most of these topics will come as a review from previous coursework, each chapter will be read and selected algorithms will be written by hand for fun. Weekly meetings will take place for any who wish to attend where the week's work will be discussed and demonstrated.

#### Schedule as of (1/7/15)

*Selected algorithms and pace of chapter readings are subject to change, other algorithms may be substituted or added to the list. As a chapter is finished and selected algorithms are complete, the next chapter will be started immediately.*
