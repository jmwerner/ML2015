ML2015
======

Machine Learning code snippets from a winter quarter 2015 independent study run in parallel with [this](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about) Stanford online course. Selected algorithms will be coded by hand and understood in depth to supplement and enhance the online course. Code will be written primarily in `Julia` and `R` because those are Jeremy's strongest languages. Although most of these topics will come as a review from previous coursework, each chapter will be read and selected algorithms will be written by hand for fun.

#### Schedule 

*Selected algorithms and pace of chapter readings are subject to change, other algorithms may be substituted or added to the list. As a chapter is finished and selected algorithms are complete, the next chapter will be started immediately.*
